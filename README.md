# Goals
* This study focuses on extensible methods to fuse sensors complementarily in different combinations.

# Assignment
* Kalman-filter-like tracking method based on the Bayesian framework with a minimum number of nodes
* Efficient graph generation method with temporal node integration
* Node pruning to mitigate the degradation of measurements from low-cost sensors

# Citation

* BibTeX CLOi-Mapper (RA-L)

# How to use the dataset

* The dataset will be released after the publication of the paper.
