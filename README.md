# Assignment
* Kalman-filter-like tracking method based on the Bayesian framework with a minimum number of nodes
* Efficient graph generation method with temporal node integration
* Node pruning to mitigate the degradation of measurements from low-cost sensors

# Citation

* BibTeX CLOi-Mapper (RA-L)

# How to use the dataset

* The dataset will be released after the publication of the paper.
* Blue dots represent nodes after pruning.
* Gray dots represent nodes before pruning.
