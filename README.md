# How to use the dataset

* The dataset (R9-home) will be released after the publication of the paper.
* Blue dots represent nodes after pruning.
* Gray dots represent nodes before pruning.

# Incremental mapping
To demonstrate how our SLAM algorithm incrementally adds a visual or LiDAR map on a prebuilt map, two case studies were
conducted as follows in cases of D1 and D2: In D1, using a prebuilt CAD map with its associated poses, our SLAM algorithm builds a pose-graph only with visual keyframes
by tracking a robotâ€™s position; In D2, using a map built from the D1 case, our SLAM algorithm incrementally associates a LiDAR keyframe to a frame node
on the backbone.

Incremental mapping results at Incheon International Airport: (a) A CAD map, (b) the mapping result of case D1, (c) the
mapping result of case D2. Gray regions are occupied spaces, and white-colored regions are free
spaces. Identical colored frame nodes means that they were generated at the same epoch.
